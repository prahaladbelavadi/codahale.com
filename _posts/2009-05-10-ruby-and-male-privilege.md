summary: In which I'm disappointed by sexism in the Ruby community.

### Act One

I read this today:

> A female computer science professor wrote:
>> [A]t a conference in France, a male speaker (French), who was speaking about
>> the importance of testing, showed an overhead slide of a naked woman with a
>> caption of the sort--'Would you buy this product without testing it
>> first?' There were only 2 or 3 women in the audience (of about 150), but I
>> had fleeting feelings of having accidentally walked into a stag party and
>> wondering if he had either not expected any women to be there or had
>> discounted the importance of directing his remarks to the women in the
>> audience.

--Ellen Spertus, *[Why are There so Few Female Computer Scientists?](http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Gender/pap/pap.html)*

Dr. Spertus wrote that paper in 1991.

In 1991, I used a gift certificate I won in a junior high car-washing fundraiser
content to purchase a tape of Pearl Jam's *Ten* from the local record store.

*Pearl Jam.*

*Junior High.*

*A tape.*

### Act Two

On April 18th, 2009, Matt Aimonetti gave a presentation on CouchDB entitled
*CouchDB: Perform Like A Pr0n Star*.

### Intermission

In the **eighteen** intervening years, what's changed?

Let me rephrase: **in the lifetime of this year's college freshman**, what's
changed?

That's a depressing question.

Here's another one: when she graduates in 2013, what will have changed for that
freshman?

### Act Three

A few days ago, I noticed this exchange on Twitter:

![blah](/images/staying-classy.png "An online exchange after the dust had cleared.")

And [this gem](http://twitter.com/dhh/status/1631342976) from David Heinemeier
Hansson, creator of Rails:
> I do think the spheres of the female body gives life wonder. Suppressing all
> our animal instincts is futile.

Ladies and gentlemen, the leading lights of the Ruby community.

### tl;dr

Read [Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists](http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Gender/pap/pap.html) and
[HOWTO Encourage Women In Linux](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/). And honestly,
I'm beginning to wonder if the women who aren't joining the Ruby community
aren't making the right choice.

**Update:** Also be sure to read
[The Male Programmer Privilege Checklist](http://lafalafu.com/krc/privilege.html)
for examples of the subtle privileges that male programmers enjoy, almost always
without knowing it.
