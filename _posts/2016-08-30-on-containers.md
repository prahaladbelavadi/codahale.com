title: "On Containers"
layout: post
summary: In which I write a blog post somewhere else.

As you may or may not know, I founded a company
([Skyliner](https://www.skyliner.io)) with some friends at the beginning of the
year, focused on making it easier to set up and operate web applications on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

I just wrote an article [about our approach to containers](https://blog.skyliner.io/the-happy-genius-of-my-household-2f76efba535a)
and the economics underlying that approach.

My co-founder [Dan McKinley](http://mcfunley.com)--he of the "choose boring
technology" motto--wrote an excellent article
[on how Skyliner deploys your applications](https://blog.skyliner.io/no-way-out-but-through-1db41c648697)
and why we built it like that.

My other co-founder, Marc Hedlund--previously the VP of Engineering at Stripe
and Etsy before that--needs to finish his blog post about why we're not a
traditionally VC-funded company. _*ahem*_

I have some thoughts about how Skyliner is the philosophical extension of my
work with projects like Dropwizard, but I'll save them for later.
