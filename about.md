title: about me

I'm a software engineer and a cyclist. I live in Emeryville, CA, and I work for
[Yammer](http://www.yammer.com), an enterprise social network, as their
infrastructure architect.

Some things I believe:

* While HTTP isn't always the best answer, it's a damn fine first guess.
* Writing tests for your code may not reduce the number of bugs, but it will
  make fixing the bugs you inevitably find easier.
* Bicycles should come stock with fenders, racks, lights, and nice fat tires.
* If a problem is worth solving, it's worth solving well and once.
* Incurious people terrify me.
* There is no such thing as untestable code.
* Over-attachment to tools is dysfunctional--don't mistake what the tool 
  allows you to do with the tool itself.
* Mornings require a french press and some
  [Blue Bottle](http://bluebottlecoffee.net/) coffee.
* The internal components of your software should exhibit the same grace and
  utility as the external components--looking under the hood should be
  delightful, not horrifying.
* People should wear more wool.
