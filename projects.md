### Talks

#### Metrics, Metrics Everywhere

*If you don't measure it, you can't optimize it.* At GitHub's CodeConf in 2011, I
spoke about Yammer's service-level performance metrics, how we used them to guide
our development strategy, and how you can improve the transparency of your own
software.

Sadly, that talk wasn't recorded, but you can find the slides
[here](https://codahale.com/codeconf-2011-04-09-metrics-metrics-everywhere.pdf).
I ended up giving the talk again at Pivotal Labs a few months later, which
[was recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czes-oa0yik).

#### The Programming Ape

*Humans, you may have noticed, are not exactly rational.* And yet here we are,
trying to get them to build software. Itâ€™s a bit of a mess. But there is some
good news: by drawing on modern theories of human cognition we can begin to
optimize our tools for how people think, not how computers work. At PhillyETE
2012, I spoke about my experience at Yammer building human-centric tools for
engineers, layed out the sociotechnical challenges facing organizations trying to
build transparent architectures, and mentioned in passing how all of that relates
to making money.

#### The Other Side Of Software Architecture

*Obviously, you care about the craft of programming.* You spend time honing your
skills, refactoring your code, learning new techniques, and experimenting with
different libraries. But did you know where you sit, who you talk to, and how you
report to your manager all affect the way your software is structured?
In 2012, I was invited to Etsy's Code As Craft series and spoke about how
organizational structures influence software and the implications for designing
scalable, resilient software systems and companies.
